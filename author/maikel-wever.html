                <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>If you've noticed this blog, then you're probably interested in DroidPile. So what is DroidPile?</p>
<p>DroidPile is an idea I had some time ago, reading over the Mailpile indiegogo page. 
There is a perk there, to hire a developer to create a Android application, but the perk was never funded.</p>
<p>In February, I have to think of a assignment for school, to keep me busy for half a year, 
and after some consideration, I decided I wanted to create an Android application that's used as a Mailpile client.</p>
<p>So that's what I'll do, create an Android application that's a client for Mailpile.</p>
<p>The name? Not very original, right? But that's not the point of the name of the application. 
It is supposed to be easy to remember, which I think it is.</p>
<p>The application will provide the following key actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composing and sending a new email via the Mailpile instance.</li>
<li>Sending and recieving attachments with emails.</li>
<li>Pulling the Inbox from the Mailpile instance (periodically), and show notifications on new messages.</li>
<li>Searching all your emails, using the fast and powerful Mailpile search (so that's server-side)</li>
<li>Pulling your contacts from your Mailpile instance, and using that for sending emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following ideas may be implemented at a later point in time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merging your Mailpile contact with the phone-global contacts and saving existing entries in Mailpile.</li>
<li>Backing up your photos and videos on your phone to Mailpile (if Mailpile will support that kind of storage, mockups suggest it will).</li>
</ul>
<p>Development of DroidPile will start in February, and is planned to finish with a 'Minimal Viable Product' half a year later.
The application will most likely be available freely on Google's Play Store, and the source code on GitHub. There will be no ads in the app.</p>            </article>
