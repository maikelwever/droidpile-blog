Summary: Small post about this blog and DroidPile.

Hello all,

If you've noticed this blog, then you're probably interested in DroidPile. So what is DroidPile?

DroidPile is an idea I had some time ago, reading over the Mailpile indiegogo page. There is a perk there, to hire a developer to create a Android application, but the perk was never funded.

In February, I have to think of a assignment for school, to keep me busy for half a year, and after some consideration, I decided I wanted to create an Android application that's used as a Mailpile client.

So that's what I'll do, create an Android application that's a client for Mailpile.

The name? Not very original, right? But that is not the point of the name of the application. It is supposed to be memorable, which I think it is.
