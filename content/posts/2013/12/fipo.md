Summary: Small post about this blog and DroidPile.


Hello all,

If you've noticed this blog, then you're probably interested in DroidPile. So what is DroidPile?

DroidPile is an idea I had some time ago, reading over the Mailpile indiegogo page. 
There is a perk there, to hire a developer to create a Android application, but the perk was never funded.

In February, I have to think of a assignment for school, to keep me busy for half a year, 
and after some consideration, I decided I wanted to create an Android application that's used as a Mailpile client.

So that's what I'll do, create an Android application that's a client for Mailpile.

The name? Not very original, right? But that's not the point of the name of the application. 
It is supposed to be easy to remember, which I think it is.


The application will provide the following key actions:

* Composing and sending a new email via the Mailpile instance.
* Sending and recieving attachments with emails.
* Pulling the Inbox from the Mailpile instance (periodically), and show notifications on new messages.
* Searching all your emails, using the fast and powerful Mailpile search (so that's server-side)
* Pulling your contacts from your Mailpile instance, and using that for sending emails.


The following ideas may be implemented at a later point in time:

* Merging your Mailpile contact with the phone-global contacts and saving existing entries in Mailpile.
* Backing up your photos and videos on your phone to Mailpile (if Mailpile will support that kind of storage, mockups suggest it will).


Development of DroidPile will start in February, and is planned to finish with a 'Minimal Viable Product' half a year later.
The application will most likely be available freely on Google's Play Store, and the source code on GitHub. There will be no ads in the app.
